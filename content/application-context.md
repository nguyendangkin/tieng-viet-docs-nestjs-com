### Standalone applications

There are several ways of mounting a Nest application. You can create a web app, a microservice or just a bare Nest **standalone application** (without any network listeners). The Nest standalone application is a wrapper around the Nest **IoC container**, which holds all instantiated classes. We can obtain a reference to any existing instance from within any imported module directly using the standalone application object. Thus, you can take advantage of the Nest framework anywhere, including, for example, scripted **CRON** jobs. You can even build a **CLI** on top of it.

#### Getting started

To create a Nest standalone application, use the following construction:

```typescript
@@filename()
async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.createApplicationContext(AppModule);
  // your application logic here ...
}
bootstrap();
```

#### Retrieving providers from static modules

The standalone application object allows you to obtain a reference to any instance registered within the Nest application.  Let's imagine that we have a `TasksService` provider in the `TasksModule` module that was imported by our `AppModule` module. This class provides a set of methods that we want to call from within a CRON job.

```typescript
@@filename()
const tasksService = app.get(TasksService);
```

To access the `TasksService` instance we use the `get()` method.  The `get()` method acts like a **query** that searches for an instance in each registered module. You can pass any provider's token to it. Alternatively, for strict context checking, pass an options object with the `strict: true` property. With this option in effect, you have to navigate through specific modules to obtain a particular instance from the selected context.

```typescript
@@filename()
const tasksService = app.select(TasksModule).get(TasksService, { strict: true });
```

Following is a summary of the methods available for retrieving instance references from the standalone application object.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code>get()</code>
    </td>
    <td>
      Retrieves an instance of a controller or provider (including guards, filters, and so on) available in the application context.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code>select()</code>
    </td>
    <td>
      Navigates through the module's graph to pull out a specific instance of the selected module (used together with strict mode as described above).
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

> info **Hint** In non-strict mode, the root module is selected by default. To select any other module, you need to navigate the modules graph manually, step by step.

#### Retrieving providers from dynamic modules

When dealing with [dynamic modules](./fundamentals/dynamic-modules.md), we should supply the same object that represents the registered dynamic module in the application to `app.select`. For example:

```typescript
@@filename()
export const dynamicConfigModule = ConfigModule.register({ folder: './config' });

@Module({
  imports: [dynamicConfigModule],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Then you can select that module later on:

```typescript
@@filename()
const configService = app.select(dynamicConfigModule).get(ConfigService, { strict: true });
```


#### Terminating phase

If you want the Node application to close after the script finishes (e.g., for a script running CRON jobs), you must call the `app.close()` method in the end of your `bootstrap` function like this:

```typescript
@@filename()
async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.createApplicationContext(AppModule);
  // application logic...
  await app.close();
}
bootstrap();
```

And as mentioned in the [Lifecycle events](./fundamentals/lifecycle-events.md) chapter, that will trigger lifecycle hooks.

#### Example

A working example is available [here](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/tree/master/sample/18-context).
